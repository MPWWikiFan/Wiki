The code within this repository represents the hypothetical configuration settings of a personal site running the MediaWiki software, the open-source software that powers Wikipedia. Because there is currently no
server or database connected to it, this code is NOT FUNCTIONAL and should NOT be used to attempt to power an actual MediaWiki installation. Additionally, the code here is based on MediaWiki 1.38, which is no longer
supported upstream but is the latest version before major changes were made to the core software. Official documentation of this software can be found at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.38. Settings that
have since been deprecated or removed in later versions of MediaWiki may still be included in these files. If you are looking for your own MediaWiki installation, it is highly suggested to install the latest software
version.
